        <h1>Contextual Inquiry</h1>
<p><strong>A contextual inquiry</strong> is a direct interview which aim is to gather as much field data as possible from users for later analysis. Researchers watch the users carry out their normal activities while observing how they solve the problem, the workﬂow across multiple channels or within a system, product or service.</p>

<p>In other words, the product team observes the users in their environments, with their permission, then asks questions.</p>

<h2 id="when-we-need">When we need</h2>

<ul>
  <li>To gather a detailed understanding of users’ needs.</li>
  <li>To discover what users do (rather than what they say they do).</li>
  <li>To think of optimizing or designing complex applications with complex activities.</li>
  <li>To extract detailed data about users’ work as well as the related environment.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-do-it">How to do it</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Prepare focus questions.</li>
  <li>Before session, ask permission and schedule a time for visiting the user’s environment to watch a typical work activity and record data.</li>
  <li>During session, ask questions to help you understand what the user is doing and why while observing them. Remember to record audio and write up your notes of direct observation immediately.</li>
  <li>At the end of the session, take pictures of the user’s environment, such as picture of the entire office, or any objects. Taking pictures can remind you about the relations between people and things in the environment.</li>
</ol>
