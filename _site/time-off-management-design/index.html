        <h1>Time Off Management Design</h1>
<p>Time-off is an exciting topic to discover, although most of the companies keep using dull tools — e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheet templates — to manage holidays and time off requests.</p>

<p>Some tools require a high-level of Excel skill to create a useful template but none of these tools can be used quickly, and the most important thing just occurred to me that people don’t need color palettes or complicated features. Instead, they want to focus on content without distraction.</p>

<p>I approached few people — including HR manager, executives, and CEO of startup companies — about answering some general questions.</p>

<h2 id="context-of-use-user-goal-and-context">Context of Use (User, goal, and context)</h2>
<p class="w400"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/time-off/context-of-use.png" alt="context-of-use" title="A Venn diagram showing user, goal and context" /></p>

<p>Interviewing potential users can help you build products that are rooted in a deep understanding of their goals. Frankly, trying to make a better version of Excel doesn’t the right way I’m heading towards. I attempt to understand the user’s context in which users are trying to achieve their goals.</p>

<p>I prefer to approach them in direct interviews instead of using survey forms because I think the online survey forms don’t include the context, which means it is not enough information for us to discover what they do (we just know users and their goals at all). From there we will know on which suitable type of product we’d better focus.</p>

<h2 id="three-steps-workflow">Three steps workflow</h2>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/time-off/layers.png" alt="layers" title="Three layers" /></p>

<p>I split interview audiences into three groups: controller, supervisor, and employee. Sometimes we use two steps, employee requests time off and supervisor checks and decides the employee absence. The number of groups might vary according to the scale of business, but each group has a very different and significant goal.</p>

<p class="highlight-paragraph">A controller expresses interests in seeing enough described information before she takes more time to verify that it is following correctly to company’s rule. A supervisor cares deeply about the ways of spreading the workload in his team, while employees are the ones who merely want to take their leaves as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="red-routes-key-tasks">Red routes (key tasks)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.userfocus.co.uk/articles/redroutes.html">Red routes</a> are the key tasks that users want to carry out with the product.</p>

<h4 id="controller-eg-hr-director">Controller (e.g. HR Director)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Manage company’s policy</li>
  <li>Check employee’s leave record</li>
  <li>Take action on an application</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="supervisor">Supervisor</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Check the effect of employee’s absence on workload</li>
  <li>Take action on an application</li>
  <li>Deal with ‘advance sick leave’ or an emergency case</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="employee">Employee</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Manage time off requests</li>
  <li>Take the leave handover</li>
</ul>
