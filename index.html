    Analyze contract value, build dashboard and sales pipeline for sales and

  </p>
  <p>
    OneOnOne English is an ed-tech startup based in Vietnam, providing online
    ESL courses to children aged 4-12 by connecting young learners with North
    American teachers in virtual classrooms. So far, we have a large number of
    data with more than 65 thousand leads. My scope in 1on1 is to help
    salespeople boost their performance by optimizing their workflow and
    providing useful tools.
  </p>
  <h4>Analyzing Contract Value</h4>
  <p>
    Here are steps of
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/ooo/data-clean" target="_blank"
      >data collection, preparation and cleaning</a
    >
    in which I used the filter styles with groupby and pivoting of Pandas, and
    <b>the interpretation</b> I extracted from
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/ooo/data-exploration" target="_blank">data exploration</a>
    with bar charts, heatmaps, and the range of value highlight in the table.

  <h4>Building Dashboard of Sales and Marketing</h4>
  <p>
    Visually tracks, analyzes
    and displays key performance indicators (KPI), metrics and key data points
    to monitor the performance of Marketing, Sales and
    Customer Services. They are customizable to meet the specific needs of a
    department and company.
  </p>
  <p>
    I took responsibility of designing views and working with engineers to develop these views. The
    concept applied here I called <b>Blocks</b> linked to a database that allows the
    report to be constantly updated.

  <h4>Building Sales Pipeline</h4>
  <p>
    A sales pipeline is a visual snapshot of where prospects are in the sales
    process. Sales pipelines show you how many deals salespeople are expected to
    close in a given week, month or year and how close a rep is to reaching
    their sales quota.
  </p>
  <p>
    It contains a control bar (allowing users search, filter or view
    properties), and a Kanban (card-based) view of qualified leads which are
    allocated to every members.

<div id='zoop' class="section">
  <h2 style="margin-bottom: 5px">Zoop Health</h2>
  <p class="summary">
    - Coordinate with business and product team to create a minimal CRM for healthcare. <br />
    - Analyze clinics data, and provide dashboards to monitor their business performance.
  </p>

  <p>
  Zoop product is designed for healthcare providers to manage their customer through interactions. 
  The aim is to help them develop longer lasting relationships with their customers, drive business growth and increase customer loyalty.</p>
   
  <h4>Leading the business customer interviews and evaluating data quality</h4>
  <p>To make the connection between Clinics and their customers better, we have to quantify the value of quality and convenience of their interactions.</p>
  <p><b>Quality of interactions</b></p>
  <p>Is the feature going to help HP understand thoroughly their customers? For example,<br>
    <ul>
    <li>Receive feedback promptly on product/service – quality, price, availability, others.</li>
    <li>Monitor service experience - appointment response time, quality of communication, and other suggestions for improvement.</li>
    <li>Feeling that HP cares their customers as a person via personalized content.</li>
    <li>More one-on-one time with their customers via chat or reminder.</li>
    </ul>
   </p>
    <p><b>Convenience of interactions</b></p>
    <p>Is the feature going to improve HP’s day-to-day workflow? For example,<br>
    <ul>
    <li>Shorter wait times for appointments</li>
    <li>Quicker access to appointments</li>
    <li>Quicker update information related to services</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Developing Customer Journey Map</h4>

    Here is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13XvJy1OU_QsxTYUgMjQFqhVfl4BJvuIf/edit#gid=617998136" target="_blank">
    insightful outcome of customer research</a> (via interviews with
    healthcare providers and patients) conducted by the BD team. The most critical pain points of healthcare
    providers generally are in <b>Advertising</b> (to their customers),
    <b>Reminder</b> (increase show-up possibility, maximize capacity), and
    <b>Check-out</b> (manage cashflow, improve service).

   <h4>Building sample analytics dashboard for clinic</h4>
   <p>I designed this view and worked with my analyst team to run expriements with clinics. Due to using MVP (as a quick experiement), 
   so I created it in <a href="https://plotly.com/dash/" target="_blank">Dash Plotly</a> that loaded data from CSV booking files provided by clinics.
   The key dashboard context here based on the purpose of every clinic owner: to see timely booking and revenue in a time range.

  <h2 style="margin-bottom: 5px">Influencer Marketing Platform</h2>
  <p class="summary">
    - Buil a centralized logging system to track in-and-external users behaviors and activities.
    <br />
    - Design all-in-one dashboard for influencer profiles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hiip is a social media marketing platform which aims to connect brands and influencers, help them work together through social campaigns. We call it Influencer Marketing. Apart from Vietnam, we also served 2 other markets, Thailand and Indonesia at the same time.
  </p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/hiip/2.png" />
  
  <h4>Creating centralized Logging System to track user's behaviors</h4>
  <p>
    When I was carrying out some research into the user insight of real concern on campaigns, I found that both Brands and Influencers cared about the campaign, but Brands knew precisely their requirement, whereas Influencers hadn’t any idea at all. That means there were many conflicts between sharing information and working on content in every campaigns.</p>
  <p>
  Therefore, we should track the routes from creating to reporting campaign to know which essential aspects influence user’s decisions. Then I, with the dev team, define all metrics (both user and business) to track user activities via actions and save params into the database. </p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/hiip/1.png" />
  <h4>Building Influencer List Filter</h4>
  <p> Brand users want to seek the best information or compare between service of influencers. 
  They want to revamp the influencer profile, which is supposed to be incomprehensible, and can’t solve for any purposes of users.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Data Presentation</b>:I work with the cross-functional teams to agree on the way we visualize criterias on filter.

  <h2 style="margin-bottom: 5px">Token System Engine Product</h2>
  <p class="summary">
    - Develop customer experience flow and monitor customer satisfaction.<br />
    - Build dashboard for customers to manage their business performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    TSE product is a marketing service that is able to provide the token as another modern communication channel. 
    These passes can only be used and applied as event tickets, cards, coupons and membership cards via a mobile device 
    to make payment or scan information.
  </p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/mmp/6.png" />
  
  <h4>Mapping Experience Flow</h4>
  <p>
    Audi wants to find another communication channel (a direct communication but faster) that can replace the traditional phone calls. When a driver meets a big problem (e.g., car crash or car engine broke down), he calls Audi Call Center for support. Then the case manager must call to the third-party car repair and get the exact time to pick up the driver. After received a confirmation, she backs to the driver and proposed the time the car repair service will arrive. Then she has to wait for a response call from the driver or she takes the initiative to call the driver to know the problem is totally solved or not?
  </p>
  <p>
  Then we propose the TSE for Audi client. The case manager can create cases (delivered via Apple passes), manage cases, search, or receive notifications). The driver can view the time and information of the car repair service provider, seed feedback of quality of Audi call center service.
