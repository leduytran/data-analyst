Assuming the sign in form has 2 fields, username and password. When a user has entered incorrect details into the form, there are *3 common errors* that happen:

1. username does not exist.
2. username is correct but the password is wrong.
3. username and password are incorrect.

Every error has a different message associated with it. It could be "The username/password you have entered is invalid" or "Username or Password is incorrect".

I see mostly forms tell me Username or Password is incorrect, for any reason. It makes me frustrated but honestly, it is the safe way to present errors that are understandable enough. Username and password only pass when used in combination. If something’s wrong, e.g username doesn’t exist, I think we can use the non-technical copy instead of just the boring *“___ is incorrect”* in error messages.

#### Sign in
![login]({{ "/assets/img/login-error-messages/1.png" | absolute_url }} "Sample 1")

#### Example 1
![login]({{ "/assets/img/login-error-messages/2.png" | absolute_url }} "Sample 2")

#### Example 2
![login]({{ "/assets/img/login-error-messages/3.png" | absolute_url }} "Sample 3")

#### Example 3
![login]({{ "/assets/img/login-error-messages/4.png" | absolute_url }} "Sample 4")
